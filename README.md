# Transaction Classifier

## About
Program to take my bank account statements and classify them. The idea being that I should be able to break down where
my money has been going.

## Background
I like knowing where my money is going. It seems like every fucking month it just disappears into thin air.

So, previously, I would keep a budget "spreadsheet" and go through bank statements and assign each transaction (usually
something I spent money on) to a "category". This worked well... until I had kids and had no time to spend an hour a
week doing a budget.

This is where this comes in. Basically, it should (over time) start slowly automating the manual classification of this
crap.
